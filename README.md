# Android Maze Project for CS 301: Software Development

The maze originally was made by Paul Falstad and was edited by Peter Kemper, a Computer Science professor at the college of William & Mary, to be used in class.

I implemented Kruskal's algorithm for maze creation and a robot driver, then ported the maze java application to Android. The main java code is located in app\src\main\java\sungwonkang\cs301\cs\wm\edu\amazebysungwonkang.
