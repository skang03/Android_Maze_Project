# Android Maze Project for CS 301: Software Development

The maze originally was made by Paul Falstad and was edited by Peter Kemper, a Computer Science professor at the College of William & Mary, to be used in class.

I implemented Kruskal's algorithm for maze creation and a robot driver, then ported the maze java application to Android. The main java codes are located in /app/src/main/java/sungwonkang/cs301/cs/wm/edu/amazebysungwonkang.
